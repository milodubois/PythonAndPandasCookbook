# PythonAndPandasCookbook

**[IN DEVELOPMENT]** 

_A quickstart guide with recipes for beginners with minimal experience in Python and Pandas for data science (collaborators are welcome)._

## Why _This_ Guide?

Many people interested in data analysis and data science are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resources for learning. Often, these guides lead to "tutorial hell" and nothing gets absorbed. The purpose of this quickstart and cookbook is to familiarize the reader with basic Python concepts by diving directly into data analysis and data science scenarios.

We will focus initially on setting up proper development environments (includnig virtual environments) and the proper tools to get the job done.

This project is intended for anyone interested in using Python to analyze data, whether for fun or for career development.

This project will eventually take the form of an online book and/or e-pub. By no means is this meant to be exhaustive, but merely a good starting point such that the reader can find more specific and detailed resources, without wasting time in "tutorial hell".

## What's Covered?

Tentatively, the chapters are:

1. 5-min intro to Python
2. _Mise en place_ (getting things in place)
3. Why Pandas?
4. Series objects
5. DataFrame objects
6. Cleaning data
7. Exploring data
8. Manipulating data
9. Where has the time gone? (time series)
10. Putting it all together (5 real-life examples with sample data)

Collaborators are welcome. See forthcoming CONTRIBUTING.md and wiki for how to help with this project.
